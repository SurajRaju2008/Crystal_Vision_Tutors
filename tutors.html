            <h3>Suraj Raju</h3>
            <p>I'm a sophomore at William Fremd High School, actively involved in basketball, Model UN, Business Professionals of America, and volunteering at Shri Shirdi Sai Mandir. These experiences have taught me leadership, teamwork, and dedication. I started Crystal Vision Tutoring group and built this website because I saw how many students in my community were struggling in this competitive schooling enviornment, and I wanted to make a difference and help my community achieve their academic goals.
